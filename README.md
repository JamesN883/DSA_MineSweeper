First, you need to download all the files and images.
There are three packages: control, model, and view, containing 9 different classes.
The main method is in the GameFrame class.
To run the project please first check the pathway to the image file of LoadData class is correct.
I coded on Eclipse, but it should be fine running on IDE after checking the previous one.
Run the code and enjoy the game!

I have recorded my presentation but for some reasons, they are not loading. If they work with you then that is great, but please allow me to send it through email in case it does not work.
